# Creating Exercises

Everyone knows that self-learning is crucial for success as a developer.  But how do you self-learn self-learning without already having learned how to self-learn?

One of the most valuable skills you can have as a self-teaching programmer is how to learn every last drop out of even a simple example of code.  This repo will help you get part-way there by providing you with some tips on how to turn any snippet of code into a whole series of exercises.

Creating and practicing exercises created from a single well-designed snippet will force you to explore the same code from many different angles.  Not only will you learn more from less code, but your learning will be stronger.

## Specification

Identify the skill or concept you want to practice, then design and practice a series of related exercises.  There are two primary ways of doing this:
    
__The Unkown Unkown__:  
    1. Start with an example you don't understand but would like to understand.  This could be from a tutorial, a project you're studying, a bug in your project you can't figure out, ... 
    2. Deconstruct that example into a series of exercises and practice the exercises until you can do them with your eyes closed.  
    3. Make some more exercises and practice those!  Each round of creating and practicing new exercises will deepen and reinforce what you learned in the previous round.

__The Known Unknown__.  
    1. Identify a concept or skill you sort of understand, but would like to master.
    2. Construct (or find) a very simple example that isolates this skill or concept.
    3. Turn this example into a series of exercises, then practice them until you can do them with your eyes closed.
    4. Find a new example that isolates the skill or concept, and repeat this process.
